His gaze straight at me, like how a ' + animal + ' stares at its prey.I’m a psychiatrist, my job is to interview patients. He’s been here for some time now, but I’ve never seen him communicate with other patients. He always stayed in the corner of the room. Needless to say, he was an eccentric ' + noun6 + ' .This is a judicial ' + Adjective2 + ' hospital. The only difference between this is the way we treat patients with a criminal record, to prevent the patients from another infraction.His silence didn’t help at all. "Do you know this?" I ' + verb2 + '  out a picture in front of him, it showed a set of black-rimmed glasses on the road, this was his crime scene..He stared at the picture and spoke softly, “This is from my best friend.""Can you tell me something about it? “I asked but he just stared at me without saying a single word. "Look, since you came here, we have not been making any progress. If you can tell me something about this, then just tell me about it. Please.” After I finished my plead, he heaved a sigh and said, “Its rather a long story…”His story is about a very quiet teen in the class who was accused of stealing a watch which belonged to a very popular classmate. This caused him to be bullied by a group of students. He and one of those students named Tom became friends, but later found that his friend had framed him. They argued at the rooftop and Tom accidentally fell to his death. This is the photo of Tom’s glasses after the accident occured."I tried to save him, I tried to pull him up, but he let go of my hand, I didn’t know what he was thinking at the time." He finished his story, then looked down at his hands. He seems to be thinking about something. Recalling seemed to give him anxiety.I had predicted this before he said anything. The patients who were sent here as well as their cases are recorded in their files. Intriguing cases  from high schools are very common for teens like Otis. Bygone memories of the past fade. But not in the case of Toms death. Maybe that’s why Helen can’t forget the past or forgive himself."What happened after that?" I continued my questions, at least were making some improvement. "After Tom died, Halloween was just around the corner, and the school had a Halloween party, and everyone had to dress up. I prepared a mask one night before the event, I was tired so I napped ... and then I found myself here."In the file, it stated that he killed 17 people that night. No one knows how he did it. They don’t rule out the fact more than 1 person was involved."Do you remember what happened during the party? Any details?" I asked. But he shook his head and then continued to look down at his fingers, "Doctor, why am I here?" He asked quietly."Because you are ill." I answered. He rose his head in response. "Come on, you are only 14 years old, your future is still very bright." I gave him a pat and smile, hoping to cheer him up. I want to let him know that I’m his friend, not an enemy.This was what I said to that boy, this was the first time that her ever spoke more than a word. Well, at least he was talking now. We made good progress here.The atmosphere always suffocates me, maybe because this is a hospital. Not a best place for a sane person to stay for long.I get surrounded by different patients every day. I had grown accustomed to it until now. I feel something unfamiliar. I feel like I am a frail sheep amongst a pack of hungry wolves. I am pretty sure this place is  slowly eating my sanity away little by little.Something in Helen Otis’s file stuck with me. I decided to ask him in person in the next coming interview.We met in the small room like the previous time. I greeted him with a smile and he responded with a few blinks. I took that as a greeting from him.As I sat down at my place, I flipped open my notes on his case and looked him in the eyes. I questioned the femininity of his name. "Helen? Did your parents name you this?"He thought for a minute then told me that his parents had difficulty conceiving children, and they were eager to have a daughter, but instead gave birth to a boy. Due to his mother’s weak health and their financial situations, they couldn’t have any other children as much as they hoped so. They decided to raise their only son as a daughter.As he finished his sentence, he fell into silence. As I was thinking what kind of response I should give, he opened his mouth again.Not only does his name sound feminine, his parents also bought girl’s clothing for him when he was younger, raised him like a daughter instead of a son. Neighbours and children around the area did not know that he was actually a boy.When he reached the age of six, he had to go to school. Afraid that, the way he was raised will cause a huge concern, his parents tried changing their ways, finally treating him as a son. Maybe this is why he has some feminine characteristics."My parents are very fond of me, and I understand their difficulties, so I have not complained about them. I do not think they have any problems." His family is very dysfunctional. he grew up under his parent’s twisted faith and overly high expectations, which affected his growth. He lost some basic human traits, but he didn’t notice. Plus, he doesnt seem to know how to express his feelings due to the environment that he grew up in.It’s hard to change the patient’s opinion on their family’s faith, I wanted to tell him what his parents were doing is wrong but it wasnt the right time.So I kept my mouth shut.Although he rarely talks to other people in the hospital, he talks politely whenever he does.We chatted sometimes, we sat on the white bench in the park, we looked like best friends.We dont always talk about things related to hospital. We talked nonsense sometimes, and it was these moments that we both felt relaxed, especially me. I really felt the tension between us loosening.In this place, patients will randomly pick fights with one another. He wont pick fights but neither does he stop them. He always manages to avoid any form of chaos, and live peacefully. That’s pretty smart of him. In the year 2001, 3rd of October, he was discharged from the hospital after receiving treatment for 7 years and it’s time for him to return back to society. He is now 21 years old. He’s no longer the young boy I remember.I was the one seeing him off, thinking back made me feel happy for him. “Don’t you ever come back here, Helen. If you come back here again, we will only meet when you are sitting on the electric chair.” Those were the last words I said to him as I pat his shoulder and smiled, he nodded in response. He had a good nature if you asked me.I reember the look of him when he left. He wore a dark blue windbreaker and a pair of black pants, his hair was still the same messy jet black. Won’t he try to comb his hair a little?I truly hoped that I wouldn’t be seeing him in this place again.After his discharge from the hospital, he was behaving well. We sometimes talk by email or meet up at a café, we talked about what were we doing now.He works as a mover and a cleaner as a part-time job. His body has grown quite muscular, looking much healthier than when I first saw him.He saved a small amount of cash, and rented a small old house, the environment is quiet and nice. Heleen stops reading the file and smiles it was the perfect place for me to hunt and kill he laughs closing the book i think its time for another kill; he gets up and drags you away never to be seen again']
